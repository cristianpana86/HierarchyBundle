# HierarchyBundle
Hierarchy Management with Neo4j and Symfony

I got the idea for this bundle from the Neo4j documentation: http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/examples-user-roles-in-graphs.html
HierarchyBundle is using the Neo4jPHP library https://github.com/jadell/neo4jphp


When writing this bundle I had in mind modelling a company hierarchy but it can be used also for other situations.
The hierarchy is based on groups. The users are members of these groups having differend kind of role (manager, employee etc).
